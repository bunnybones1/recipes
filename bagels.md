## Method

### 1. Mix

1. Combine all **dry ingredients** in a large bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, mix all **wet ingredients**.
3. Add wet ingredients to dry and mix until a **ragged, stiff dough** forms.

   * A stand mixer may be used briefly, but this dough is hard on most home mixers.

### 2. Knead

4. Turn dough out onto an **unfloured surface**.
5. Knead for **12–15 minutes**, until smooth, firm, and elastic.

   * This is a **fairly dry dough**.

### 3. Bulk Rest

6. Cover dough and let rest on the bench for **45–60 minutes**.

### 4. Prepare Oven & Boil

7. Preheat oven to **235 °C / 450–460 °F**.
8. Near the end of the rest, bring **4 L water** to just below a boil.
9. Dissolve **honey (or substitute)** into the water.

### 5. Divide & Shape

10. Divide dough into **~100–113 g pieces** (12–13 total).
11. Roll into ropes and shape into bagels on an **unfloured surface**.
12. Place shaped bagels on a lightly floured surface, covered, while shaping the rest.

### 6. Boil

13. Gently boil bagels **3–5 minutes total**, working in batches.

    * Do not overcrowd the pot.
    * Bagels should float when ready.
14. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a tray.

### 7. Seed

15. While still damp, dip both sides of each bagel into **sesame seeds**.
16. Transfer to a **parchment-lined baking tray** (or cornmeal-dusted peel if baking on stone).

### 8. Bake

17. Bake for **15–20 minutes**, until deeply golden.
18. Flip bagels **2–3 times during baking** for even color.

    * Reduce oven temperature slightly after 10 minutes if browning too fast.

## Baking Notes

* Can be baked on:

  * Sheet trays
  * Pizza stone
  * Directly on a hearth
* **Wood-fired ovens** produce exceptional results.
* If bagels touch during baking, separate and return to the oven for a few extra minutes.
