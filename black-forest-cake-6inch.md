# Black Forest Cake (6-inch pan)

## The Cake

### Ingredients

- 4.5 large eggs, room temp
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 Tbsp (1/8 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled (not hot)
- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract

#### Items you’ll need:

- two 6″ cake pans
- a flour sifter or fine sieve
- parchment paper

#### Prep: 

- Preheat Oven to 350˚F. Line bottoms of two 6″ round pans with parchment paper (don’t grease sides).

1. Whisk 4.5 large eggs for 1 min on high speed.
2. Add 1/2 cup sugar and continue beating on high speed a full 8 min. It will be thick and fluffy.
3. Whisk together 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup cocoa powder and sift in thirds into the batter, folding with a spatula between each addition. Once all flour is in, continue to fold just until no streaks of flour remain, scraping the bottom of the bowl to get any pockets of flour hiding at the bottom; do not over-mix or you will deflate the batter.
4. Gently fold in 1/4 tsp vanilla and room temp butter, folding as you add butter in a steady stream and scraping from the bottom to make sure you don’t have butter pooling at the bottom. Fold just until incorporated. Divide batter equally between two prepared cake pans and BAKE RIGHT AWAY in fully preheated oven at 350˚F for 20-25 minutes (my oven took 22 min), or until a toothpick comes out clean. Note: Once the butter is added, it must be transferred to baking pans and put into the oven immediately or the batter can deflate quickly.
5. Let cool in pans for 10 min then run a knife or thin edged spatula around the edges to loosen cake. Transfer to a wire rack and remove parchment backing. When cakes are at room temp, and you’re ready to assemble, slice cake layers in half with a long serrated knife.

## The Filling/Syrup

### Ingredients

- 2 cups pitted cherries
- 1 1/2 Tbsp cherry liqueur (kirsch or Luxardo Maraschino cherry liqueur)
- 2 Tbsp cup cold water

1. Roughly chop pitted cherries
2. add 1 1/2 Tbsp cherry liquer. Let sit at room temp for at least 30 min, stirring a couple times
3. drain cherries in a sieve over a bowl. Keep the cherries and syrup
4. Add 2 Tbsp cup cold filtered water to the syrup to get about 3/8 cup total syrup

## The Cream/Icing

### For the Frosting/Topping:

- 1 3/4 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1/6 cup Confectioners sugar
- 1/2 Tbsp cherry liqueur (kirsch or Luxardo Maraschino cherry liqueur)
- 2 oz good quality dark chocolate

1. Whisk 1 3/4 cups heavy cream on high speed until soft peaks form
2. add 1/6 cup powdered sugar and 1/2 Tbsp cherry liquer
3. beat on high until stiff and spreadable (1-2 min)
4. Refrigerate until ready to use

## Assembling your Black Forest Cake

1. Place first cake layer on a cake stand and brush with 1/4 of the syrup
2. Cover the top with about 3/8 cup frosting (1 1/2 ice cream scoops’ worth) and top with 1/3 of the chopped cherries
3. Repeat with remaining layers and top with the flattest layer
4. Transfer 3/4 cups frosting to a pastry bag with a large flower tip and refrigerate until ready to use (don’t handle the bag too much or the cream will soften).
5. Fill the cracks along the sides of cake with frosting then frost the top and sides with remaining frosting.
6. To make chocolate shavings, melt the chocolate in the microwave, spread it thin over the back of a baking sheet with the help of a food scraper, then refrigerate a few minutes and scrape with a food scraper.
8. Cover sides and top of cake with chocolate shavings leaving a 1″ perimeter on top for piping frosting. Pipe rounds of frosting around the top of the cake and place a whole cherry over each one.
9. Refrigerate cake for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving
