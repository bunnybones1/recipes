# Butter Biscotti

## ingredients
- "wet"
  - 10 tablespoons (141 g) unsalted butter softened
  - 1 ⅓ cups (265 g) sugar
  - 3 large eggs
  - 2 teaspoons vanilla and/or almond extract
- "dry"
  - 3 ¼ cups (406 g) cups flour (all-purpose or whole wheat, or blend)
  - 1 Tablespoon baking powder
  - ¾ teaspoon table salt
- inclusions/toppings
  - ⅔ cup (66 g) slivered almonds
  - ⅔ cup (113 g) mini chocolate chips
  - ½ cup (170 g) dark chocolate melting wafers or chocolate chips for dipping biscotti optional

## instructions
- Cream together the butter and sugar until well combined.
- Add the eggs one at a time, stirring after each addition until well incorporated. Stir in the vanilla.
- Combine the dry ingredients in a separate bowl, then gradually add them into the wet ingredients. Don't overblend, you don't want the wheat gluten to stretch.
- (Optional) stir in your inclusions.
- Divide the dough into equal pieces and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Form the dough into logs with lightly floured hands.
- Bake for 30 minutes at 350F, then cool completely.
- Use a serrated knife to slice the loaves diagonally. Place the biscotti cut side down onto your baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.
- Remove your biscotti from the oven, flip them over, and bake for another 10 minutes. Allow the biscotti to cool completely before dipping or drizzling with chocolate.
