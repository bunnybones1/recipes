- 2 tsp active dry yeast  
- 1/2 tsp sugar  
- 3 cups all-purpose flour, divided

- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus more to oil the bowl

## Instructions

1. **Make the sponge**  
   - In a large mixing bowl, add the lukewarm water and stir in the yeast and sugar until dissolved.  
   - Add 1/2 cup of flour and whisk to combine.  
   - Place the bowl in a warm (not hot) place, uncovered, and let it rest ~15 minutes until bubbly.

2. **Form the dough**  
   - Add the salt, olive oil, and almost all remaining flour (reserve ~1/2 cup for dusting) to the bowl.  
   - Stir until a shaggy dough forms.  
   - Dust lightly with flour and knead in the bowl about 1 minute to incorporate any loose bits.

3. **Knead the dough**  
   - Transfer to a lightly floured surface.  
   - Knead gently about 2 minutes until smooth.  
   - Cover and rest 10 minutes, then knead again a couple more minutes.

4. **First rise**  
   - Clean your bowl and coat it with a light layer of olive oil.  
   - Return the dough to the bowl, turning to coat it lightly.  
   - Cover tightly with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel.  
   - Let rise in a warm place about 1 hour, until doubled.

5. **Divide the dough**  
   - Gently deflate the risen dough and transfer to a clean surface.  
   - Divide into 7–8 equal pieces and roll each into a ball.  
   - Cover and rest ~10 minutes.

6. **Shape the pitas**  
   - Using a floured rolling pin, roll each ball into a circle ~8–9 inches wide and ~1/4 inch thick.

7. **Cook the pitas**  
   - **Oven method:** Preheat oven to 475°F and place a heavy pan or cast iron skillet inside on the middle rack.  
     - Place rolled dough directly on the hot surface.  
     - Bake 2 minutes, flip, bake 1 more minute.  
     - Remove and keep warm under a towel.  
   - **Stovetop method:** Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.  
     - Lightly oil and wipe off excess.  
     - Cook each pita ~30 sec until bubbles form, flip 1–2 min until spots appear, then flip again 1–2 min until puffed.

## Notes

- **Make-ahead:** Dough can be made ahead and stored in the fridge after rising (keeps up to 1 week).  
- **Whole Wheat Variation:** Substitute equal parts whole wheat and all-purpose flour.  
- **Gluten-Free:** Replace with a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend (1:1).  
- **Storage:** Fresh pita is best the day it’s made, but will keep in an airtight bag for a few days or freeze up to 3 months. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
