## You'll need

### Ingredients
- Potatoes
- whole chicken (1.5kg)
- 2-3 garlic heads
- 2-3 lemons
- 1 stick butter
- olive oil
- cracked salt

### Tools
- Oven
- Pan, Oven-safe (11-12")
- Pot (medium/large)
- Kitchen Shears
- Sharp Knife
- Bowl (to make garlic butter)

## Instructions

### The Potatoes

Start with a 11" or 12" oven safe pan.

Test-fill the bottom of the pan with small potatoes or chunks of large potatoes to get an even layer. This is just for measurement.

Transfer those potatoes to a pot and boil them for 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 420F.

### The garlic

Chop the garlic heads 1/3rd from the top, exposing all the cloves. Save the garlic bits that you chopped off for the garlic butter.

### The garlic butter

Chop or crush the garlic clove tops from the previous step. 

Partially soften in the microwave, (but don't melt) 1 stick of butter

Add a tablespoon of cracked salt (not table salt) and the garlic bits, and mix into a spreadable buttery paste.

### The chicken

Ideally the chicken should be in room temperature for 30-90 minutes before roasting, or you'll need to add 5-15 minutes to roasting time.

#### Spatchcocking the chicken

Lots of videos online, but basically use kitchen shears to cut on either side of the spine, all the way down through the pelvis and ending on either side of the tail.
Discard the spine or use for chicken stock.

Find the cartilege behind the clavicle and gently cut it with a sharp knife (if you start cutting into the dark bone in the sternum, you've gone too far).
Fold the chest open flat and you should see the sternum bone sortof pop out of place. The chicken should lie flat now.

Flip the chicken over, breasts facing up. 

Take small handfuls of butter and insert them under the skin in these places, then squeeze it under like squeezing toothpaste out of an almost empty toothpaste tube, to break the connection between the skin and the muscle:
- Near the neckline, this butter will go under the breast skin.
- At the sides, near the top of the thigh, this butter will go into the tigh and the drumstick. 

Use 3/4 of the butter this way.

Spread the remaining 1/4 butter on the skin of the chicken.

### Put it all together

When the potatoes have been boiled for 45 minutes, drain them and put them as a base layer in your pan.

Place the chicken on top of the potatoes, spread flat and facing up. 
Tuck the tips of the wings under the biceps so they don't burn.

Cut 2 or 3 lemons in half.

Place the garlic heads and lemon halves beside the chicken, on the potatoes, facing up. 
Drizzle some olive oil on the garlics.
Crack some salt on the garlics and the lemons.

> [!TIP]
> If the lemon and garlic are precariously at the edge of the pan, just be sure they are tilted so their juices drip towards the chicken, not towards the edge of the pan.

Put the whole thing in the oven for 40-60 minutes. Watch until the skin is between golden brown and burgundee, depending on taste. Use a meat thermometer to be safe, with the lower part of the thickest part[^1] of the breast reaching 155F[^2]. 
[^1]: The chicken will be hotter at the top than near the potatoes.
[^2]: The temperature will equalize somewhat during the resting period, so the coldest part at 155F will continue to rise after you remove it from the oven. The goal is to reach 165F via this equalization.

Pull the pan out carefully, the potato layer is swimming in fat/butter!

Let it rest for 5 minutes.

Serve and enjoy!

> The remaining juices are reuseable for flavour in a ramen-like broth with noodles.
