# Yogurt

The gist: you're pasteurizing milk, careful not to burn it, cooling it down and then introducing a culture to it.

## You'll need

### Ingredients
- 2 litres of 3.25% milk
- 60-120g of previous yogurt

### Tools
- Oven
- Small Pot with Lid, Oven-safe
- Big metal Bowl (for icebath)
- Yogurt Incubator (Optional)

## Instructions

> [!CAUTION]
> These instructions are calibrated to a specific oven and small pot. You should take the timer durations with a grain of salt at first. Once you've gotten to know your equipment, adjust the timer durations in these instructions accordingly.

### Heat things up

Fill Small Pot with 2L of milk, cover with lid, and place in the oven

Set oven to 300F, and set timer for 1:40

When timer is complete, verify that the milk is between 175F and 185F

Turn oven down to 190F and set timer for 0:30

### Cool things down

Place the Small Pot in the big bowl

Surround the Small Pot with lots of ice, and even top up with a bit of cold water

Leave for 15 minutes (or until milk is under 100F)

### Culture

Mix the previous yogurt sample into the now-cooled milk

Transfer the milk/yogurt into a container for fermantation

Fermentation should be at 100F, for 24 hours

### You're done!

Place the container of now-fermented yogurt in the fridge for atleast a few hours before enjoying.
